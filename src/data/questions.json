Examination of several years of data revealed that 30% of the people who regularly ride bicycles in a given year do not regularly ride bicycles in the subsequent year. Additionally, 2% of the people who do not regularly ride bicycles in that year begin to ride bicycles regularly in the subsequent year. If 5,000 people ride bicycles and 100,000 people do not ride bicycles in a given year, then the following program calculates the number of cyclists in the subsequent year (cycling) and that of people who do not ride bicycles in the subsequent year (noncycling):",

For instance, if str1 is “ABXDZ” and str2 is “ABCD”, the LCS between str1 and str2 will be “ABD” and the length of the LCS will be 3. The function lcs(string: str1, string: str2, integer: m, integer: n) takes two strings str1 and str2 and two integers m and n as arguments. str1 and str2 are the strings on which the length of the LCS is calculated. m and n are indexes addressing the target characters in str1 and str2, respectively. On the first call, m and n represent the lengths of str1 and str2, respectively. The function returns an integer containing the value of the length of the LCS of str1 and str2. For instance, the function may be called as lcs('ABXDZ', 'ABCD', 5, 4). Another function max(integer: a, integer: b) is also used. The function takes two integers a and b as arguments. It compares these two integers and returns the integer value of whichever is the maximum between a and b.",

A common method handling collisions, the probing mechanism (checking for an available element), is used in the function.

Assumptions are made that no data with the same key is stored, and that at least one element in the array hashTable is {undefined} when the procedure insertData is called.

If today's weather is sunny, the next day will be rainy, sunny, or cloudy with probabilities 0.2, 0.7, and 0.1, respectively. Additionally, if today's weather is cloudy, the next day will be rainy, sunny, or cloudy with probabilities 0.25, 0.5, and 0.25, respectively.

For instance, the return value is 2 when the function hammingDistance('101010', '111000') is called, because positions 2 and 5 have different characters. It can also be extended to strings of different lengths by considering the unmatched characters as differences. For instance, the return value is 5 when the function hammingDistance('101010', '111000111') is called, because of two differences in first six characters and addition of three extra unmatched characters.",
